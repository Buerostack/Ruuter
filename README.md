# Ruuter

Ruuter is a declarative REST router that turns YAML DSL files into REST endpoints and executes each endpoint’s business logic using a strict, declarative syntax.

## Origin

Originally developed at the Information System Authority of Estonia (Riigi Infosüsteemi Amet, RIA) since June 2018. Designed and development led by [Rainer Türner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainer-t%C3%BCrner-aba66274/) until April 2025.

Ruuter's original repository is https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter

## 

This cleaned repository is maintained by Rainer Türner starting from September 10, 2025, with an intention to have clean version of Ruuter to work on, without affecting its owner RIA.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buerostack/ruuter.git
cd ruuter
docker-compose up -d
```
